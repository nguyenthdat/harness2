# Reverse engineering

Obey `RULES.md`. This skill only selects the REA or IDA operation. Capability
and IOC questions start at `skill://malware-analysis`. A schema JSON plus
`evidence.md` is `skill://static-artifact-analysis`.

Use REA when a claim depends on a shipped binary or package, decompilation, or
an offline capture, and source does not already establish it. For ordinary
analysis of a complete source repository, do not run REA.

## Registered tools

This profile already registers `ida` (official Hex-Rays IDA MCP, headless) and
`rea` (Ghidra). Do not run `rea doctor`, `rea setup`, or `npx rea-agents`, and
do not edit `mcp.json`. Engine choice is `rule://tool-routing`.

Call a connected tool with its live input schema. A skill written for a newer
REA release may name a tool this server does not advertise; skip that tool and
record the gap. Keep complete inline Evidence when the server does not
advertise retained references.

If a call fails, read [connection and recovery](references/connection-and-recovery.md)
only to classify a timeout, a bad argument, or a dropped connection. Do not
apply any setup or registration command in that note. Retry a dropped call once
only when it is safe to repeat or known not to have started. Do not repeat an
unchanged call after a timeout. Continue with IDA or read-only triage for what
those tools can answer.

For an operator-supplied JavaScript tree or ASAR, prefer the connected
`analyze_javascript_application` tool. Use an already installed `rea` CLI only
when that tool is absent:

```bash
rea analyze-javascript-application /absolute/path/to/app --json
```

Do not download a REA package to obtain the CLI. Native CLI analysis still
needs its selected engine. Do not launch the sample.

## Route the target first

Choose the first tool from the target the user supplied. Use `open_binary` for
active-target native or archive workflows; target-free tools take their own
explicit path or endpoint and do not need it.

- ASAR or extracted JavaScript/Electron tree:
  `analyze_javascript_application`.
- Archive/package member inventory (ZIP/APK/IPA/MSIX/AppX, DMG, or a PyInstaller
  executable): `open_binary` with the supplied local path; use `inspect_artifact`
  when its graph and findings help answer the question. A PyInstaller CArchive
  is the application layer; the bootloader is only the native prefix. Start with
  `detail: "summary"` for large inventories, then use retained inventory views
  for selected member fields/pages. A complete small inventory can cost less
  than extra calls and schemas. Runtime options are metadata, not files.
  Compact delivery still inventories and hashes members. See the
  [Python packaged applications guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/python-packaged-applications.md).
- Apple app plist, Interface Builder, asset catalog, or keyed archive resources:
  `open_bundle_resources`, then the selected resource tool. This does not
  require `CFBundleExecutable` or a deep provider. Resource sessions have no
  executable digest or binary snapshot; use `open_binary` for native code.
- Android APK code, classes, methods, or incoming references:
  `inspect_android_package`, then focused Android tools when advertised.
  Archive member inventory still uses the archive route above.
- Managed PE/CLI assembly: `inspect_managed_artifact`.
- Firmware image: `inspect_firmware_regions` when advertised. Use
  `extract_firmware` when extraction is requested, with a caller-selected new
  absolute output directory. These tools use caller-supplied Binwalk/Unblob on
  Linux; see the [firmware guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/firmware-analysis.md).
- .NET NativeAOT PE/ELF: native Ghidra analysis. Native code can yield pseudocode;
  consult the NativeAOT workflow in `references/native-and-artifacts.md` for
  optional metadata recovery and its supported host/layout boundary.
- Do not launch a malware sample, its installer, or a process-capture of it.
  Browser and Electron tools are only for a target the parent already has open,
  or for reading a capture file.
- User-owned browser page already open: `list_browser_targets`.
- Browser action on an app the parent already has open, and that is not the
  sample: `capture_browser_scenario` with declared actions. See
  [runtime observation](references/runtime-observation.md) for connect and the
  focused follow-up browser tools. Do not use it to launch a sample.
- Fiddler Everywhere traffic or a native `.saz` capture: read the
  [Fiddler workflow](references/runtime-observation.md#fiddler-everywhere-traffic-debugging).
  Inspect saved SAZ with `inspect_web_network_capture` and `format: "saz"`;
  connect Everywhere's separate MCP server for live traffic.
- Retained HAR/SAZ/native mitmproxy/aioquic qlog capture: `inspect_web_network_capture`. Select
  original record ordinals when useful; inspect producer fields and byte/number
  sidecars without fetching recorded URLs or claiming live attribution. HAR/SAZ/qlog
  old-generation heap is `REA_CAPTURE_DECODER_OLD_GENERATION_MIB` (default 192 MiB,
  floor 8, maximum 16384), set where REA starts. Host memory and `NODE_OPTIONS` do not
  raise it. See
  [historical captures](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/web-network-captures.md) for the exact upstream
  profile and credential exclusions. Qlog support starts with aioquic 1.5.0
  JSON 0.3; stream coverage and endpoint loss declarations do not recover bodies
  or establish network loss. Prefer detail summary, then kind qlog trace/stream
  pages; select one trace, stream ID and direction for contribution/range pages.
  Facts retain all-recorded-events-before-selection scope. Other qlog layouts
  and PCAP correlation are unsupported.
- User-owned Electron runtime already open: `list_electron_targets`. Before an electron-main Inspector attempt, check packaged fuses with `inspect_electron_fuses`; disabled `EnableNodeCliInspectArguments` means the app ignores `--inspect`.
- Packet-field discovery: `inspect_packet_fields` searches installed protocols
  and field names/types before choosing fields for `inspect_packet_capture`.
  Query/page the relevant records; registrations do not establish observed traffic.
- Recorded packet captures: `inspect_packet_capture` with selected TShark fields,
  display filters and decode-as rules. Requires Linux, util-linux prlimit and `REA_TSHARK_COMMAND`; see
  [capture guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/packet-captures.md).
  Packet limits count input packets before filtering. Output defaults to 50 matching
  frames; use `match_offset` / `match_limit` for later pages, or explicit null
  limit for complete matching output. Preserve the source digest across pages.
  This does not perform live capture.
  For address/DNS/SNI/protocol summaries use `inspect_pcap_capture` with MCP
  detail summary, then retained kind pcap pages. Requires Wireshark 4.x tshark
  and capinfos, with Linux prlimit or Windows Job Objects; see
  [packet summaries](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/pcap-analysis.md).
  Select an exact DNS question for address pages; page exhaustion does not prove
  network completeness. This reads recordings and does not acquire traffic.
- Decoder discovery: `inspect_signal_decoders` searches installed decoder IDs
  or selected decoder help, including channels and options. Query and page the
  relevant details before choosing settings; this does not scan hardware.
- Recorded logic/signal traces: `decode_signal_recording` with explicit decoder,
  channel and protocol settings. On Linux with util-linux prlimit, supply sigrok-cli 0.7.2 through
  `REA_SIGROK_COMMAND`; see [recording guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/signal-recordings.md).
  Output defaults to 50 literal lines; select annotation classes and page with
  `line_offset` / `line_limit`, or explicit null for all remaining output.
  Window counts are display lines, not annotations or samples. Preserve source digests across pages.
  This reads existing files; it does not acquire hardware signals.
- Explicit local WebAssembly artifact: `inspect_wasm_artifact`. Supply WABT 1.0.42
  through `REA_WABT_BIN_DIRECTORY`; retain exact byte/tool identity and decoded WAT.
  Select JavaScript glue and candidate paths explicitly and preserve URL/path
  ambiguity. No implicit fetch or target execution; WAT is not original source.
  See the [WASM guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/wasm-artifacts.md).
- Explicit local Android APK (or ZIP/AAB) signing: `inspect_apk_signature`.
  Prefer its summary or selected signer/digest/lineage page; retain complete
  Evidence and use `inspect_analysis_view` kind `apk-signature` for follow-ups.
  Reports which schemes are present (v1 JAR, v2, v3, v3.1), each signer's
  certificate SHA-256 fingerprint (v1 included, from its PKCS#7 block), v3 key-rotation lineage, source stamp, and
  whether each signed digest still matches the bytes (self-consistency). This
  is identity and integrity, not a trust or authenticity verdict.
  See the [APK signature guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/apk-signature.md).
- Explicit local EVM bytecode carrier: `inspect_evm_interface` with caller-selected
  `raw` or `hex` encoding. The owned worker deadline is `timeout_ms` (default
  30000 ms, range 1..2147483647, next call). It does not raise the fixed byte,
  address-space, or CPU allowances. Preserve carrier/decoded digests and treat selectors,
  argument strings and mutability as inferred candidates; this performs no chain
  lookup or target execution. For the complete inferred interface without hex or
  duplicate stdout, discover support and select `detail: "summary"`; complete
  Evidence stays retained under its original identity. Use the returned
  `parent_evidence_id` for exact function or `bytecode_hex`/stdout/stderr pages.
  Candidate coverage does not establish interface completeness. See the
  [EVM bytecode guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/evm-bytecode.md).
- Embedded Go compiler, module or build-setting metadata: `inspect_go_binary`
  with the explicit local file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no
  Go installation or disassembler. Preserve raw module bytes and source ranges;
  absent metadata does not prove a binary is not Go, and unparsed text records
  remain explicit. See the
  [Go binary guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/go-binaries.md).
- Embedded CUDA/HIP code objects: `inspect_gpu_code_objects`; inventory targets
  first, then decode selected payloads and query retained GPU Evidence.
- Bundled GGUF or safetensors model declarations: `inspect_model_artifact`
  with the explicit local file. Default header hashing leaves full-file identity
  unknown; `hash: "full"` additionally reads all weights for SHA-256. MCP returns
  retained summaries; optional `view` selects one page in the initial call. Use
  `inspect_analysis_view` kind `model-artifact` for
  batched metadata keys, tensor names or type totals, selected fields and pages.
  Preserve header-scoped indices and array preview omissions; do not infer model
  behavior from declared architecture or tensor types. See the
  [model file guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/model-artifacts.md).
- Unity IL2CPP names, member owners and string literals from `global-metadata.dat`:
  `inspect_il2cpp_metadata` with the explicit local file; MCP defaults to compact
  counts. Query sections, images, types, methods, fields, properties, events,
  parameters or string_literals through `inspect_analysis_view`
  with the returned `parent_evidence_id`, using exact filters, batch indices and
  selected fields. Parameters accept `method_indices`, avoiding a scan of all
  parameter pages. Missing collections in historical Evidence remain unknown.
  Versions 24, 27, 29, 31 and 39; no Unity, IL2CPP
  binary or disassembler is run. Unrecognized magic (possibly encrypted) and
  other versions are unsupported. Optional matching `binary_path` enables static native addresses and type references; query `method_addresses` with indices or addresses/states, preserving every shared-body method and both artifact identities. Without a linked binary native counts remain unknown. Byte-pattern fallback is inferred; no runtime behavior or same-build pairing is proved. See the
  [IL2CPP metadata guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/il2cpp-metadata.md).
- Embedded cargo-auditable Rust dependency metadata: `inspect_rust_binary`
  with the explicit local ELF, PE, or thin Mach-O file. This built-in
  target-free inspection requires no Rust installation or disassembler. Preserve
  package order, dependency indices, and the section file range. A missing
  `.dep-v0` section is null metadata, not proof the binary has no dependencies.
  A rustc commit hash is an inference from a read-only `/rustc/<40-hex>/` path.
  For selected crates, use `view: {collection: "packages", names: [...],
  fields: ["name", "version", "source"]}` on the first call; explicitly include
  `dependencies` for direct index references. Use `detail: "summary"` for counts
  and ranges, or retained `inspect_analysis_view` Rust package/edge pages for
  subsequent filters. Keep the complete parent Evidence accessible; CLI compact
  delivery requires `--evidence_output`.
  See the
  [Rust binary guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/rust-binaries.md).
- PE import and delay-load tables: `inspect_pe_imports` with the explicit local
  PE32/PE32+ file. No Windows SDK. Preserve DLL names, named and ordinal
  imports, ILT/IAT RVAs, delay-load descriptors, and the import hash. A missing
  import directory is absence of that table, not proof the image never resolved
  APIs another way. An import with no use is not a capability.
- PE TLS callbacks and load configuration: `inspect_pe_load_config` with the
  explicit local PE32/PE32+ file. No Windows SDK. Preserve callback VAs with
  RVA, file offset, and section, plus the size-covered cookie, SafeSEH, CFG,
  and related fields. Guard flags are linker declarations, not proof they are
  enforced. A missing directory is absence of that declaration.
- PE Authenticode certificate table: `inspect_pe_certificates` with the explicit
  local PE32/PE32+ file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no
  Windows SDK. Preserve WIN_CERTIFICATE ranges, types, payload SHA-256, and
  PKCS#7 signer/X.509 identity fields, including `subject_key_identifier_hex`
  when the signer uses that form. A missing security directory is observed
  absence of that table, not proof the image is unsigned in every catalog sense.
  Signatures are not verified. See the
  [PE certificate guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/pe-certificates.md).
- ELF note tables: `inspect_elf_notes` with the explicit local ELF32/ELF64
  file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no disassembler. Preserve
  PT_NOTE and SHT_NOTE ranges, owners, types, descriptor SHA-256, and GNU
  build-id or ABI-tag fields. A missing table is observed absence of those
  declarations, not proof the image never carried notes. See the
  [ELF notes guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/elf-notes.md).
- CPython 3.7–3.13 `.pyc` header, nested marshal code objects and bytecode
  identity: `inspect_python_pyc` with the explicit local file. This built-in
  target-free inspection requires no Python installation. Preserve magic,
  PEP 552 hash or mtime/size, nested names, and bytecode SHA-256. Bytecode is
  not decompiled, and a decoded header does not prove the matching `.py` is
  present. See the
  [CPython pyc guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/python-pyc.md).
- Erlang BEAM IFF container: `inspect_erlang_beam` with the explicit local
  `.beam` file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no Erlang
  installation. Preserve chunk names, atom order, export/import/lambda tables,
  and the Code header. Missing optional tables stay null. Bytecode is not
  executed. See the
  [Erlang BEAM guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/erlang-beam.md).

- Explicit local SQLite database snapshot: `inspect_sqlite_database`. Inspect
  with Node.js 24.x >=24.15 or 26+ providing native SQLite limits. Read schema
  first (compact inventory by default), or select an exact ordinary table
  and `columns` when rows are needed. Defaults are selected-table schema and
  20 rows; request `schema_scope: "database"` for the complete stored schema. Preserve both database and existing sibling WAL identity; row samples
  report truncation and have unspecified order. Use a quiescent snapshot rather
  than assuming a live database/WAL pair was copied atomically. See the
  [SQLite guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/sqlite-databases.md).
- Explicit Linux ELF file for offline layout, symbols, relocations or static
  mitigation evidence: `inspect_binary_layout`. This target-free operation uses
  caller-supplied pwntools without opening a disassembler database. Preserve its
  raw locations and inference/coverage limits; see the
  [offline binary guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/binary-diagnostics.md).
- Supplied Linux x86-64 ELF core: `inspect_recorded_crash`. Read every recorded
  thread, raw note and source-bound register without opening a live target.
  Historical PIDs do not select live processes. Request `include_debugger_context`
  only when core-only mapping candidates help; see the
  [recorded crash guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/recorded-crashes.md).
- PE resource type/name/language trees and static icon group references:
  `inspect_pe_resources` with an explicit path. This portable operation requires
  no active target or engine; opaque payloads retain file ranges and SHA-256.
- PE export directories and ELF dynamic-symbol exports: `inspect_native_exports`
  with an explicit path; portable, no active target or engine.
- Native executable, library, or analysis database: `open_binary`, then
  use focused analysis tools directly; call `binary_overview` when metadata or
  inventory context is useful and available from the selected provider.

Native decompilation on this profile uses the official `ida` MCP, not REA
`provider_id: "ida"` and not OMP's native `ida` tool. Follow
`rule://tool-routing`. Do not pass an `.idb` or `.i64` as the input. REA
`open_binary` is the Ghidra path when IDA cannot take the file.

With `REA_KUNA_COMMAND` configured, `provider_id: "kuna"` answers procedure
lists, lookups, pseudocode, assembly and `analyze_function` from Kuna's cached
whole-program export. Callers/callees use a separate body-free graph shared by
the session; `xrefs` returns exact-address incoming sites and filters forwarding
aliases. These queries and inventory lookups do not trigger a C export. Indirect
targets remain unknown and can make relationship coverage partial. Reference
caches expire on close; a fresh CLI process repeats the native reference walk.
Typed references, CFG, raw-memory tools and annotations remain unsupported. A cold first
answer can come from a single-function run (its limitations say so); assembly
waits for the export. For pseudocode and assembly, `raw_result.source` names the
cached `.c`/`.asm` file and byte span, which you may search directly instead of
calling per function. See the
[Kuna provider guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/kuna-provider.md).

If the user says only "my app" without a name, path, or target already selected
for this task, ask which app before searching for artifacts. Paths in unrelated
saved reports and nearby test fixtures do not select the user's target. Resolve
an actual human-readable app name to one clear installed artifact when possible;
ask when matches are ambiguous. Never choose an example app on the user's behalf.

In a target-free session, use `open_binary` to bind any archive/package or
native target whose analysis tool operates on the active target. Do not call an
unadvertised tool; inspect `binary_session` with `{}` and its
`result.tool_availability` for availability reasons and remediation. Expand each
group's `names` into entries, inheriting the inventory-level client requirements
unless the group overrides them. In its closed effect and annotation vocabularies,
listed flags are true and omitted known flags are false. The grouped name union
is the complete tool inventory; use `tools/list` for canonical tool schemas.
Provider candidate facts describe possible providers, while top-level session
capabilities describe the current route and `analysis_provider_binding` names the
selected provider. Do not treat those scopes as interchangeable.

For a Ghidra startup timeout on a large native target, follow
[deadline recovery](references/native-and-artifacts.md#ghidra-startup-deadline-recovery)
before abandoning deep analysis or repeating the same cold import. The default
330 seconds is configurable; changing the server's environment requires a new
REA process.

## Work summary-first

Start with the default result and use its inline Evidence and graph context.
For a JavaScript application or ELF layout whose size is unknown or large,
call `analyze_javascript_application` or `inspect_binary_layout` with
`"detail": "summary"`, then inspect the retained `parent_evidence_id` with
`inspect_analysis_view`.
Page module identities and select the returned `node_id` before requesting an
item; a single file path can represent several graph roles. Do not repeat an
identical analysis or rejected call without a changed input or resolved blocker.
Recheck session state when a lifecycle change makes that status useful.
Make a focused follow-up only when the
returned result leaves a specific question unanswered.

If MCP reports `resource_constraint` with `details.resource: "transport"`, call
`inspect_analysis_view` with its reported same-session Evidence reference for a
summary, one section/module, or a stable page. Use `trace_application_feature`
once a seed is known, or call `export_evidence_bundle` to write the complete
session to a selected path. The analysis remains complete in the ledger; avoid
repeating it merely to request the same oversized response. Complete CLI JSON
output also streams without a single MCP frame.

When the retained parent ID is unknown, use `get_evidence_bundle` with
`detail: "summary"` and exact filters for operation, target SHA-256,
analysis-profile digest or canonical procedure address. Select its returned
Evidence ID for the next view instead of requesting the complete bundle.
`retention: "complete-record"` means the whole record is stored; native
value-flow truncation and unknown metadata remain separate. For an exported
portable bundle, use `rea inspect-evidence-bundle` with JSON containing `path`,
`detail: "summary"` and the same `filters`. Reading that file still requires
validating its full contents within the local memory budget.

A client can also truncate a successful tool result without a REA transport
error. Treat that preview as incomplete; use the retained parent ID for smaller
views or export when the full record is needed. Do not parse the preview as
canonical JSON or repeat the producer. For JavaScript, read the
[module-view and trace recipes](references/javascript-applications.md) before
drilling into a large graph; a broad bidirectional trace can expand unrelated
containment relationships even after summary analysis.

Every conclusion must distinguish observations, inferences, and unknowns. Cite
Evidence IDs, preserve limitations and incomplete coverage, and never imply
that static analysis observed execution. Do not launch, attach to, or
instrument the sample to produce that evidence.

Within the user's requested investigation, call available analysis tools
directly. REA does not require permission grants or per-call approval flags.
The agent client can independently require approval. Follow the declared request
scope and the host's actual access requirements; use the recovery guide for an
observed client-policy rejection.

## Plan broader investigations

For requests that span multiple features or subsystems, use a staged workflow:

1. Turn the request into a checklist of questions and the evidence each answer
   needs. Resolve target identity and constraints from the conversation and
   workspace before asking for information again.
2. Inspect the current REA session, artifact identity, saved analysis database,
   bookmarks, and prior evidence. Reuse matching state; do not open duplicate
   sessions or repeat identical analysis.
3. Start with the smallest useful overview or inventory. Follow each question
   from its entry point through relevant data and state changes to its result.
   Batch related operations around a specific hypothesis, then expand only when
   the returned evidence leaves a concrete gap.
4. Inspect relevant packaged resources and configuration alongside code when
   they affect the question. Use format-aware inventory and parsers; do not
   infer behavior from filenames, strings, or layout alone.
5. Corroborate a conclusion with static evidence or an offline capture the
   parent already supplied. Do not launch the sample to obtain a runtime trace.
6. Decompose work into independent questions and answer them in this session.
   Do not spawn subagents or task agents. Keep one finding ledger.
7. Keep a concise finding ledger linking each conclusion to Evidence IDs,
   confidence/evidence type, search boundary, and remaining unknowns. Update
   the shared index or investigation report so later passes can reuse results.

Before finishing, revisit the original checklist. Mark each question as
answered, partially answered, or unresolved based on its evidence; keep
bounded negative searches bounded, and do not describe a broad investigation
as complete while required questions remain open.

## Finish the task

Explain findings in plain language and tie them to returned evidence. Do not
turn the analysis into a port, a product, or another agent. Close an opened
native session with `close_binary` when the investigation is complete, and
close any IDA database this session opened.
